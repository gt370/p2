### Question 2

First we aggregate total emissions from PM2.5 for Baltimore City, Maryland (fips="24510") from 1999 to 2008.

```{r baltimore,cache=TRUE}
baltimoreNEI <- NEI[NEI$fips=="24510",]
aggTotalsBaltimore <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year, baltimoreNEI,sum)
```

Now we use the base plotting system to make a plot of this data,

```{r plot2}
barplot(
  aggTotalsBaltimore$Emissions,
  names.arg=aggTotalsBaltimore$year,
  xlab="Year",
  ylab="PM2.5 Emissions (Tons)",
  main="Total PM2.5 Emissions From All Baltimore City Sources"
)
```

**Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008?**

Overall total emissions from PM2.5 have decreased in Baltimore City, Maryland from 1999 to 2008.
